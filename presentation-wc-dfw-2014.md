# Goal

## Create a Framework to Pick the best E-Commerce Platform For Each Project

# [fit] E-Commerce
# [fit] Experience

^ Who here already has e-commerce experience? What platforms have you used?

^ Have you built the site for a client or for yourself?

# [fit] Platforms

# Platforms

* Self Hosted WordPress
* Self Hosted Non WordPress
* Hosted Platform
* Hosted Payment

^ There are four types of e-commerce solutions you can use. I'm going to go into the specific solutions in just a sec but this presentation is going to be more about the types of solutions not the specific solutions.

# Platforms

* Self Hosted - WordPress
 * WooCommerce

^ Self Hosted WordPress solutions are plugins that you add to your own site. Running an e-commerce site on WordPress is kind of like owning a house. You can do anything you want to your house. You can add more paint the walls, add new appliances, rip out carpet, or you can completely refurbish your place.

^ the downside is that you have to mow the lawn, clean the windows, when the basement floods you have to fix it or pay someone to fix it for you.

# Platforms

* Self Hosted - Non WordPress
 * Magento

![right|fit](assets/images/platforms/magento.png)

^ So Magento is the only non-wordpress self hosted solution I'm listing here. It's got a lot more features built in but because of all of those extra features it's harder to use and maintain. If a self hosted WordPress site is a house then this is a mansion. It's probably has a yoga room, a ball room, one of those really long tables, and a pool which is great if you want all of those features. But if you don't need those features it's a lot of extra maintenance. That's why a lot of people who have mansions have full time helpers.

# Platforms

* Hosted Platform
 * Shopify

^ Hosted platforms are pretty great and I'm being serious here. I think hosted platforms are great especially for someone doing their first store and the reason is that you have less responsibility. It's kind of like leasing an apartment. If your dish washer breaks you submit a maintenance ticket and by the time you come home from work there's a note on your kitched table that they fixed it. Pretty awesome.

^ The downsides of course if that over the long term you're paying more money and you have no control over the apartment. You can't paint the walls, and you can't expand your apartment at all. You could be using the apartment for a year and then get a note that rent is doubling the follow year. Once you're settled into an apartment it sucks to move.

# Platforms

* Hosted Payment
 * Gumroad

^ Using a hosted payment is kind of like using a tent. It's very easy to move, it's cheap, and you can set it up in 30 minutes flat.

^ The downsides are that you don't want to do this all year round. If e-commerce is you main business you don't want to be in a tent sure you can decorate your tent the way you want but it's so small. Unlike a house you can't possible add a pool.

# Platforms

* Hosted Payment
 * Gumroad
 * PayPal Buttons

# [fit] WooCommerce

^ E-Commerce is very complex. I promise you that no one here wants to build the exact some store as someone else. One person wants to offer (PayPal, Amazon, and Credit Card payments), someone else wants to offer discounted pricing to members, someone else wants to book massages online. WooCommerce is extensible. Very extensible.

^ Who here already has a WooCommerce store?

^ What type of store do you want to build?
